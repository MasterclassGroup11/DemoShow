# FLUID AND FLOW TOKEN FARMING.
Unemployment has always been a major problem especially in Africa as a continent where most places are still developing.

The main purpose of this project is to help users get any kind of jobs either White Collar, Blue Collar or Black Collar job.
How this project work is fluid holders would get to stake their fluid token in return for the kind and format of job available in respect to their qualifications and year of experience. Apart from the fact that the fluid holder staked his/her for a job search by the user, the user would still get flow token in return as a benefit for using our platform to search for a job.
